## What will the product do?
The product will allow for cross-service sharing of playlists.

## Why are we creating this product?
We are creating this product so that users of streaming music services can send playlists to users of a different streaming music service, and so that users can easily port their playlists to a different streaming service.

## Who will benefit from our product?
This service will prove to benefit people who are users of both services who are in need to have a way to port their playlists. Additionally, it will help users who may have friends using a differing service be able to share their playlists with one another. 

## How does the product compare against similar products already on the market?
Compared to similar services, our product will not be able to match the same variety of available streaming music services, however, compared to common workarounds that people are using, our solution is easier to use.
