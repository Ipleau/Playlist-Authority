# Playlist Authority

## Vision Statement

Our target market is streaming music service users who have multiple streaming accounts. The product is for those users who want a service that can import, export, move, and share their playlists between accounts from the many other streaming music services available. Our product, Playlist Authority, has the advantage of being safe, user friendly, and will streamline the process of playlist sharing between multiple music platforms. Unlike most common workarounds and existing competiting products, our solution will be easier to use and account based, meaning features not limited to password protection, user history, sharing options, etc. Our product offers the service on an online browser, accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
